Stock Market Prediction 

üìà Capstone Project: Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning
1. Project Title:
"Forecasting Stock Prices with Machine Learning Models"

2. Objective:
To predict future stock prices based on historical data using machine learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), Random Forest Regression, and Linear Regression, and compare their performance.

3. Problem Statement:
Stock markets are volatile and influenced by multiple factors. Predicting stock prices can help investors make better decisions. Traditional methods struggle with complex patterns in financial time series data, but machine learning may capture these patterns more effectively.

4. Data Sources:
Yahoo Finance API (using yfinance Python package)

Example Stocks: Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT)

You can also expand to indexes like S&P 500 (GSPC).

5. Tools and Libraries:
Python

Libraries:

numpy, pandas, scikit-learn

matplotlib, seaborn

keras, tensorflow (for deep learning)

yfinance (for data collection)

6. Methodology:
Data Collection:

Download historical stock price data (e.g., last 5 years).

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.

Feature engineering: moving averages, RSI, etc.

Train/Test split (e.g., 80/20).

Model Building:

Model 1: Linear Regression

Model 2: Random Forest Regressor

Model 3: LSTM Neural Network (for sequential patterns)

Evaluation Metrics:

MSE (Mean Squared Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

Visualization:

Plot actual vs predicted prices.

Feature importance (for Random Forest).

Conclusion:

Which model performed best?

Real-world implications.
