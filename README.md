Stock Market Prediction 

üìà Capstone Project: Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning
    1. Project Title:
    "Forecasting Stock Prices with Machine Learning Models"

2. Objective:
           To predict future stock prices based on historical data using machine learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), Random Forest Regression, and Linear Regression, and compare their performance.

3. Problem Statement:
Stock markets are volatile and influenced by multiple factors. Predicting stock prices can help investors make better decisions. Traditional methods struggle with complex patterns in financial time series data, but machine learning may capture these patterns more effectively.

4. Data Sources:
Yahoo Finance API (using yfinance Python package)

Example Stocks: Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT)

You can also expand to indexes like S&P 500 (GSPC).

5. Tools and Libraries:
          Python

Libraries:

    numpy, pandas, scikit-learn

    matplotlib, seaborn

    keras, tensorflow (for deep learning)

    yfinance (for data collection)

6. Methodology:
   Data Collection:
## üìä Dataset

        Download historical stock price data (e.g., last 5 years).



Model Building:

    Model 1: Linear Regression

    Model 2: Random Forest Regressor

    Model 3: LSTM Neural Network (for sequential patterns)

Evaluation Metrics:

     MSE (Mean Squared Error)

     RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  
     MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

Visualization:

    Plot actual vs predicted prices.

    Feature importance (for Random Forest).



# Capstone Project: Stock Price Prediction

## Abstract
This project aims to predict the future stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) using various machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

## Problem Statement
Stock price prediction is critical for investors but is highly challenging due to market volatility. This project attempts to model and predict stock prices using historical data and machine learning techniques.

## Methodology
- Data collection using Yahoo Finance API.
- Feature engineering with moving averages and returns.
- Model training with Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM.
- Evaluation using MSE, RMSE, and MAE.

## Results
Random Forest provided the best overall accuracy among traditional methods, while LSTM showed promising results for sequential pattern learning.

## Conclusion
Machine learning models can provide valuable predictions but are still limited by real-world uncertainties.

## Future Work
- Include sentiment analysis from news headlines.
- Use more complex deep learning architectures.
- Develop a real-time prediction web app.






## üöÄ How to Run the Project

---

### üß™ 2. Run the Notebook (for analysis & modeling)

Open and run the notebook: 

Open the final project.ipynb in googel collab 
then run it step by step code 

### üìä 3. Launch the Dashboard

it will ask you the stock 
Enter the stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, AMZN): 
Enter the number of years of historical data to fetch (e.g., 2, 5): 

and then 
it will show you the results for next 5 days predicition :
and also will display the accuracy in  %
